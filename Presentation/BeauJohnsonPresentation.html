		<p>1. Do you mind providing me with some background information about you? (eg Where are you from? School? Art background etc)<br>

<span class="purple">I grew up in a suburb outside of Dallas, TX (Rockwall, TX). I studied graphic design at CalArts (which I discovered via the internet) afterwards and have lived in Los Angeles since then. Prior to going to CalArts, I was really interested in making websites, which I started doing when I was around 12. I was lucky enough to have access to a computer and internet access at the time.</span><br><img src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/-xVdbJ7XY5sA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/wG9LdA9WQLo/s88-c-k-no/photo.jpg"><br><br>





2. Did you always do mostly digital work or did you start in another medium?<br>


<span class="purple">Yes mostly digital, I used to think that making websites was ‘graphic design’.</span><br>
<br>




3. If you had to give yourself some kind of label, what would it be? (Designer, Coder, Web Artist, Artist...)<br>


<span class="purple">Usually the unfortunate ‘web developer’ (or worse, ‘web designer’), but it’s appropriate. I’m only an ‘artist’ when I make something of my own.</span><br>
<br>




4. Do you mind talking about some of your inspirations or topics you tend to address? <br>


<span class="purple">Some inspirations in no particular order:</span>
<ul>

<li>Comedy</li>

<li><a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=william%20gibson">William Gibson</a></li>
<img src="http://www.appscout.com/images/gibson.jpg">

<li><a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=simcity&spell=1">Sim City</a> (Will Wright)</li><img src="https://buildingdebates.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/sim-city.gif">

<li>websites like craigslist, wikipedia</li>

<li>7-11 (especially its array of self-serve zones)</li>
<img src="https://lh5.ggpht.com/G9JUJ0TFIY4jWyrW0k21vuvyRjv81Fn2Aa_F8VSfodB07x-7R5VHOLTZEqPqMbCgIgIc=w300">

<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0835010/">The TV series ‘How It’s Made’</a></li>
<img src="http://img.rlsbb.com/images/2013/04/15/How_Its_Made.jpg">

<li>All forms if free online-learning i.e. youtube, opencourseware, khan academy, etc.</li>
</ul>



<span class="purple">I like letting a medium influence the work that’s made. i.e. :

Pixel art is a natural format for a computer screen.<img src="snack.png"><br><br>



So I try to approach projects with that in mind, i.e.:

How does a joke live on the internet? How can a computer make it better?</span><br><a href="http://www.officialwebsiteofamerica.com/">officialwebsiteofamerica.com</a><br><a href="http://www.everyoneloses.com/">everyoneloses.com</a><br><a href="http://www.ataleoftwosittings.com/">ataleoftwosittings.com</a><br><a href="http://www.meandbillgatesandstevejobs.com/">meandbillgatesandstevejobs.com</a><br><br><span class="purple">



Or work from the other direction, i.e.:

The internet makes it really easy to click on text and go to URLs. How can this mechanic be used for something I’d like to create? <br><a href="http://www.slowcarsslowwomen.com/">slowcarsslowwomen.com</a><br><a href="http://www.calrats.com/">calrats.com</a><br><br>

I also love the way that you can create your own branded ‘universe’ on the web, essentially for free. You can leave your work scattered everywhere, and not worry about tripping over it when you go to bed. It also allows you to publish ideas very rapidly, with virtually no extra development. I’m not very good at working on one project for very long, so I try to create more modular pieces of work, or formats of work, that can live together as a whole. <br><a href="http://www.officialwebsiteoftheuniverse.com/">officialwebsiteoftheuniverse.com</a><br>
<br></span>






5. It seems like you do both conceptual web art, but also more commercial design for clients. Can you speak to the differences in creating each of these kinds of work?<br>


<span class="purple">The only similarity is usually in programming practices. The two might share a design/visual sensibility, but only if a client is gracious enough to allot me that authority. I’m fairly shameless about client work, and generally try to do as they wish. Doing work is a barter of time for money, so I don’t approach it with any pretense of it needing to be about me, or even ‘by’ me (though I am selective on what I show as a ‘portfolio’). I’m much more interested in making my own work than in having a revered commercial career.<br><img src="1.jpg"><img src="2.jpg"><img src="4.jpg"><img src="5.jpg"></span>
<br>
<br>



6. I'm curious about a lot of your personal projects and how they come about?<br>


<span class="purple">It varies greatly. Sometimes I come up with an idea and make a website within the same hour, and sometimes I spend months thinking about an idea and drawing it up in sketchbooks before it actually reaches a publish-able form. I’m usually most motivated to actually work on something when I really want something to exist that I can’t already find, and want to see it.</span> <br>
<br>




7. Do you mind speaking about the specifics of a couple of your favorites and how you came to them?<br>


<span class="purple">I like <a href="http://www.babysuggs.com/">babysuggs.com</a> because it’s probably the rawest, and the easiest to update. I essentially made it to publish things that were already scattered in sketchbooks. <a href="http://www.snackdata.com/">Snackdata.com</a> is also a favorite because people actually visit it sometimes. Before making it, I was thinking a lot about how data is purchased/sold, and how it’s a kind of currency today. I didn’t really own any valuable data that isn’t already available, so I decided to make my own database out of some food drawings. The concept was developed with an understanding of relational databases already in mind. Also, everyone is familiar with food, so the subject was perhaps more successful (in terms of traffic) than other websites I’ve made – I definitely had an intention of trying to make something more accessible for a wider audience.</span><br><br>
<br>




8. Once you create these works on the web, what is the reception like? Do you think the internet is a beneficial platform for the spreading of information or can things be easily lost in cyberspace?<br>


<span class="purple">The reception is normally extremely passive. I think the internet is the best vehicle for sharing information, but yes, things are very easily lost. It’s nice that it’s a very accessible publishing platform, but gaining the attention of a large audience almost always requires a vast amount of resources. I do believe though, that even with a small audience, you will eventually gather a user base if you’re persistent at publishing quality work.</span><br>
<br>




9. Do you ever do any sort of physical displaying of work? (Gallery, museum etc) <br>


<span class="purple">No (or extremely rarely). I’m not opposed to it though.<br><a href="http://www.j-o-h-n-s-o-n.com/">j-o-h-n-s-o-n.com</a><br><img src="clothes.jpg"></span><br>
<br>




10. You seem to be a pretty quiet presence online, even though your work is all over. Do you find comfort in the kind of anonymity the web can provide? <br>


<span class="purple">It’s nice when work ‘discovered’ and seems like a little treasure, but like most people, I would like it to be more popular! At the same time, I enjoy the fact that there can be some deeply hidden work that provides extra satisfaction for anyone willing to sleuth.</span> <br>
<br>




11. Can you tell me a little bit about any current projects or where you hope to go in the future?<br>


<span class="purple">I’m working on another site that’s similar to my snack website (snackdata.com), but it’s about basketball.<br><img src="http://www.hohe-hs.eu.dodea.edu/Activities%20and%20Clubs/BoysBB/images%20for%20boysBB/basketball.gif"></span><br>
